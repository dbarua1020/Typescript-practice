# Typescript-practice


This repository serves as a timeline of my journey learning TypeScript. It includes various code examples that demonstrate how my understanding of statically-typed JavaScript has evolved over time. From basic type annotations and interfaces to more advanced concepts like generics, decorators, and type inference, each commit reflects a new concept or technique I've explored. The goal of this repo is to track my progress, showcase practical TypeScript concepts, and provide a reference for future projects as I continue to deepen my expertise in building scalable and robust applications.
